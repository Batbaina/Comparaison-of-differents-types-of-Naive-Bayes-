# Comparaison-of-differents-types-of-Naive-Bayes-
This project present the differents types of Naive Bayes algorithm, which is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes’ theorem by making also the comparison between the different types  and  with other types of machines learning algorithms by giving a Highlight of their strengths and weaknesses.
